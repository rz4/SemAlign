    "# SemAlign: Semantic Alignment Using Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Rafael Zamora-Resendiz\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this quick project, we explore the use of pre-trained word embeddings for sequence-based semantic alignment of text. The algorithm used for sequence-alignment used in this short exploration is inspired by the Smith-Waterman algorithm commonly used in bioinformatics for local alignment of genetic sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smith-Waterman algorithm uses a substitution matrix which encodes whether specific genes are the same or not. Here, we explore the use of a similarity matrix between words in two texts instead of a substitution matrix to perform the sequence alignment. The similarity matrix is calculated by finding the cosine distance between the embedded vectors of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow for a more fuzzy alignment of the two texts, a gaussian kernel of a set n-gram size is used to convolve over the sequences in order to better match inter-word dependencies."
